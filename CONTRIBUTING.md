# Contributing

We're glad you're interested in contributing. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

1. **Read the documentation**: before contributing, make sure you have read the project's documentation to understand how the project works and what is expected of contributors.
2. **Follow the code of conduct**: all contributors are expected to follow the project's code of conduct. This includes being respectful to others, avoiding offensive language, and accepting constructive criticism.
3. **Submit clear and concise issues**: if you encounter a problem or have a suggestion, submit a clear and concise issue on the project's issue tracker. Include as much detail as possible to help others understand the issue.
4. **Contribute code**: if you want to contribute code, ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the project's coding standards. Submit your code as a pull request and be open to feedback and suggestions.
5. **Review and test pull requests**: if you are not contributing code, you can still help by reviewing and testing pull requests. Provide constructive feedback and test the code to ensure it works as expected.
